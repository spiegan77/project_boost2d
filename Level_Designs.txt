LEVEL DESIGN IDEAS

---LEVEL 01---
Player starts out in the middle
Tries to fly
Hitting STart Button instead ---- Walls close in (tagged with a unique tag to disable thrust)
Player falls down a long tunnel
TODO: I'm trying to figure out to disable the Cinemachine Confiner when I collide with the Start Button
When they land Thrust is re-enabled (tagged object)
	Can that tagged object also enable a Box Collider/ Renderer
Player has to fly to checkpoint
