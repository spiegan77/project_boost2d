LEVEL DESIGN IDEAS

---START SCREEN---
2D Course Simple Follow Camera *MIGHT* be a dirty fix for this issue
Player starts out in the middle
Tries to fly
Hitting STart Button instead ---- Walls close in (tagged with a unique tag to disable thrust)
Player falls down a long tunnel
TODO: I'm trying to figure out to disable the Cinemachine Confiner when I collide with the Start Button
When they land Thrust is re-enabled (tagged object)
	Can that tagged object also enable a Box Collider/ Renderer
Player has to fly to checkpoint

---LEVEL 01---
Landing Pad is blocked
Player pushes a block that lands on a trigger that unblocks landing pad
  Player can't land on the switch because they explode



A cool mechanic might be dropping an object and then racing it to the finish
if the object get there first the player explodes like a bitch
